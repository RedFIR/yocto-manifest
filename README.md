Repo Manifests for the Yocto Project Build System
=================================================

Getting Started
---------------
**1.  Install Repo.**

Download the Repo script:

    $ curl http://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/git-repo-downloads/repo > repo

Make it executable:

    $ chmod a+x repo

Move it on to your system path:

    $ sudo mv repo /usr/local/bin/

If it is correctly installed, you should see a Usage message when invoked
with the help flag.

    $ repo --help

**2.  Initialize a Repo client.**

Create an empty directory to hold your working files:

    $ mkdir yocto
    $ cd yocto

Tell Repo where to find the manifest:

    $ repo init -u git://github.com/RedFIR/yocto-manifest.git 

A successful initialization will end with a message stating that Repo is
initialized in your working directory. Your directory should now
contain a .repo directory where repo control files such as the manifest are
stored but you should not need to touch this directory.
